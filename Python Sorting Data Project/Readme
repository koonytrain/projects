This project was completed by using Python with PyCharm IDE for my Intro to Application Development class. </br>
We were given the raw_data.txt file to figure out what errors there were within the data. </br>
Once the errors were fixed we put it into the cleaned_data.txt file. </br>
This file was then filtered multiple ways using the create_data_analysis_reports.py file.
